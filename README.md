# Drout Case
This repository is used to cotain my class project working with analysis skills and _Excel_. The project includes analysis of customers' perception of gender stereotype and empowerment advertising. 

## Repository 
- Gender stereotype: Gender stereotypes are often used in beauty product marketing and specifically draw on cultural views of what makes a desirable, acceptable, and handsome man or woman. They also regularly take advantage of particular gender roles. For example: Women need to be slim, while men need to have sharp features to show their feminity and masculinity.

- Empowerment: Gender stereotypes are dispelled by empowerment advertising tactics, which also graphically convey each person's distinct differences. Men and women are supposed to reflect the range of body types, perceived levels of femininity and masculinity, and beauty in empowerment advertising.

The repository  includes:
- `Reports_Drout_Case`: My personal report for this project

## Conslusion: 
- Advertisers can gradually shift to empowerment messaging to fully convey the inclusivity message in their marketing campaigns. This will increase engagement and create a stronger cultural impact on society. 
- However, in order to not eliminate any potential clients, advertisers do not need to exclude immediately the campaigns for traditional advertisements, but keep for members who want to follow the beauty standards.
